# Homey App Upload

CLI tool and library to make developing apps for the [Homey home automation](http://athom.com) platform a bit easier.

The purpose is to allow for incremental app updates to be pushed to Homey during app development.

## Installation

This tool consists of two parts: a library that you need to include in your Homey app, and a CLI (command line interface) tool that you should install on the computer you are developing on.

### Library

#### Installation

```bash
$ cd path-to-your-homey-app
$ npm install homey-app-upload-lib
```

#### Usage

The library needs to be initialized from the `onInit` method of your app, and should be passed your app's manifest as an argument:

```javascript
const HomeyAppUpload = require('homey-app-upload-lib');

...

class YourHomeyApp extends Homey.App {
    onInit() {
        HomeyAppUpload(this.manifest);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

Remarks:
* The library requires the `homey:manager:api` permission, and will refuse to run when it isn't set.
* The library should not be used in published apps.

### CLI

#### Installation

```bash
$ npm install homey-app-upload-cli -g
```

#### Usage

```
homey-app-upload â€“ Homey App Upload

Usage:
  homey-app-upload [options] upload

Options:
  -h --help                Show this screen
  -v --version             Show version
  -I --incremental=<file>  Allow incremental updates, using `file` for metadata
  -H --host=<host>         Homey hostname/IP-address
  -P --port=<port>         TCP port for upload server [default: 5481]
  -N --no-restart          Don't restart app after changes have been uploaded

Instead of passing -H/--host/-P/--port, you can set an environment variable
HOMEY_APP_UPLOAD_SERVER that contains the URL for the upload server:

    export HOMEY_APP_UPLOAD_SERVER=http://192.168.1.100:5481/
```

First, run `athom project --run` to upload the app to Homey initially. Keep it running, and open another window/terminal from which to run (incremental) updates using this CLI tool.

By default, the CLI tool uploads the entire app. If you want incremental updates, use the `-I` option:

```
$ homey-app-upload -I .inc upload
```

The purpose of the `.inc` file is to keep track which files have changed since the last upload. When doing an incremental upload, only the changed files will be uploaded, typically reducing the upload time significantly when compared to uploading the entire app.

After uploading, the default action is to restart the app. This can be prevented using the `-N/--no-restart` option.
